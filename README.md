# 404 StarLink Project - 404星链计划

![](D:/program/404StarLink-Project/logo.png)

The "404 Starlink Project" is a plan started by the Knownsec 404Team in 2020. It aims to maintain and promote the tooling of different links in various fields of security research through open source or open methods, just like Starlink Similarly, link researchers based in different security fields and different security links.

These are not limited to large-scale tools that break through security barriers, but also various small tools related to optimizing the daily use experience. In addition to the opening of the tools developed by 404 itself, it will also continue to collect pain points in the process of security research and penetration testing. Through the "404 Starlink Project", the various problems of complex tools, uneven levels, and open source and unmaintained in the security circle are improved, and a technical atmosphere for promoting and communicating with better and more open security tools is created.



“404星链计划”是知道创宇404实验室于2020年8月开始的计划，旨在通过开源或者开放的方式，长期维护并推进涉及安全研究各个领域不同环节的工具化，就像星链一样，将立足于不同安全领域、不同安全环节的研究人员链接起来。

其中不仅限于突破安全壁垒的大型工具，也会包括涉及到优化日常使用体验的各种小工具，除了404本身的工具开放以外，也会不断收集安全研究、渗透测试过程中的痛点，希望能通过“404星链计划”改善安全圈内工具庞杂、水平层次不齐、开源无人维护的多种问题，营造一个更好更开放的安全工具促进与交流的技术氛围。

# Project

This category mainly aggregates various security tools, and prefers complete projects with higher availability.

## Zoomeye Tools

Tag:

- Chrome crx
- Zoomeye
- Pentest

### Project link：

[https://github.com/knownsec/Zoomeye-Tools](https://github.com/knownsec/Zoomeye-Tools)

### Project Overview：

Zoomeye Tools includes Zoomeye minitools and Zoomeye preview.

Minitools is currently integrated for use in zoomeye.org, copy all targets in multiple formats, and enter the next scan in a convenient and quick way.

Preview implements a simple Zoomeye interface. When a user login and clicks on preview, he can quickly and easily see various information of the current station ip and open port information.

## Pocsuite3

Tag:

- Python3
- Pentest

### Project link：

[https://github.com/knownsec/pocsuite3](https://github.com/knownsec/pocsuite3)

### Project Overview：

pocsuite3 is an open-sourced remote vulnerability testing and proof-of-concept development framework developed by the [**Knownsec 404 Team**](http://www.knownsec.com/). It comes with a powerful proof-of-concept engine, many powerful features for the ultimate penetration testers and security researchers.


# Minitools

This category mainly aggregates gadgets and scripts involved in various security research processes, aiming to optimize the daily security automation experience.

## ipstatistics

Tag:

- Python
- ipip
- ip filter

### Project link：

[https://github.com/knownsec/Minitools-ipstatistics](https://github.com/knownsec/Minitools-ipstatistics)

### Project Overview：

ipstatistics is a script based on the ipip library that is used to quickly filter the ip list. It can quickly filter out countries, regions, and exclude ip targets in special regions.



## cidrgen

Tag:

- go
- Scan

### Project link：

[https://github.com/knownsec/Minitools-cidrgen](https://github.com/knownsec/Minitools-cidrgen)

### Project Overview：

cidrgen is based on cidr's subnet IP list generator, which quickly solves the pain points of expanding subnets during scanning.
